Credit Card Fraud Detection (94%)

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and classification models with resampling techniques to handle imbalance.

Overview
- Dataset: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Goal: Classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate
- Accuracy Achieved: 94%

Features
- **EDA**: Visualizations of class imbalance, feature distributions
- **Preprocessing**: Scaling features, handling imbalance with SMOTE
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, precision-recall curve

Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
